The SmartBox Hub has multiple sensors to change the RGB lighting as well as LCD Display that shows the temperature , color , humidity as well. This project will allow people to tell the temperature and humidity of the room with light indication. We also purchased a separate daughter board in order to connect the LCD panel with less wiring to save the trouble of being messy. Each person did a part, our focus was creating a hub like device through design, and then implement each sensor into the program. We are still trying to figure out how to create a program mode to manually switch out the functionality of each program , meaning if they just wanted to change the light to turn on through the touch capacitor then it wouldnâ€™t interfere with the thermat sensor to change color of the same light. In retrospect we could wire the light to a secondary bulb, or even to a completely different lighting system.
